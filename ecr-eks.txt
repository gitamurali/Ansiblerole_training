To deploy an image from an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repository to an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster using Ansible, you can follow these steps:

Create an ECR repository and upload your Docker image to it.

Create an EKS cluster if you don't already have one.

Write an Ansible playbook that performs the following tasks:

Install the necessary Ansible modules (e.g. boto3 and kubernetes)
Authenticate to ECR using AWS access keys or IAM roles
Retrieve the latest image tag from the ECR repository
Create a Kubernetes deployment that references the latest image from the ECR repository
Apply the deployment to your EKS cluster using the kubernetes module
Run the playbook using the ansible-playbook command.
