# Adhoc commands are single line commands
# BY using this single command we can configure files on multiple hostts using inventory file.
# The differnce between adhoc command and ansible-playbook: we can save the ansible playbook and can use multipole times, 
# but with adhoc commands we need to write each and every time when evr we want to configure some thing on multipkle hosts.
# Very rarely we use Adhoc commands, like if we want to transfer simple files on multiple hosts we can use Adhoc commands.
